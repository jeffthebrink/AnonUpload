# AnonUpload

### Description

The AnonUpload assignment is built with Java using the Spring framework, password encryption, and utilizes a H2 database. The 
display and deletion of the files is handled via JavaScript. Once on the user is on the page, they can upload files and may 
optionally select to make the file permanent and set a deletion password. In order for a file to be deleted, the correct 
password must be input. An unlimited number of "permanent" files may be uploaded, but only ten "non-permanent" files may be 
uploaded before the oldest is automatically deleted upon the uploading of a new file.
